Implement the decentralized mutual exclusion algorithm for one shared critical section with at least 5nodes on different machines.Each node requests in random intervals access to a virtual sharedresource aka the critical section. Upon receiving access it willuse the resource for a couple of seconds before releasing itagain.Try to built a resilient decentralized access system thatguarantees exclusive access to the critical section in bothfailures scenarios.
